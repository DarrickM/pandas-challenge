The provided data includes 15 schools and information on students,
 reading and math scores, school type, and their budget.Through 
this I was able to calculate data on average test scoresand passing 
rates, per capita budget, school size, and how they correlate 
between each other. For example, schools with larget per capita 
budgets have an on average lower test scores and passing rates. 
And, charter schools have an on average higher test scores and 
passing rates.
